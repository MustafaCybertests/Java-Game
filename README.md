<h1>Java Guessing Game Journal</h1>

For my Final exam in my Intro to Java Programming couse I had to create my own Java Journal!
- The Java Journal documents my learning process with Java, including problem-solving approaches, code implementation, and debugging strategies. It also covers key Java concepts like object-oriented programming, data structures, and exception handling. The journal includes test results, challenges faced, and reflections on progress throughout my learning journey.

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a simple number guessing game implemented in Java. The user is tasked with guessing a randomly generated number within a specific range (1 to 100). The program provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

- <b>Task<b>: Create any Java program of your choosing, with a focus on applying fundamental programming concepts.
- Implementation: I decided to implement a number guessing game where the player guesses a random number between 1 and 100.
- Functionality:
- The program generates a random number within a specified range (1 to 100).
- The user inputs their guess, and the program tells them whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct.
- The program keeps track of the number of attempts the user makes until they guess the correct number.
- After guessing correctly, the user is prompted with the option to either play another round or exit the game.
- Purpose: This project was developed as part of an assignment aimed at practicing Java basics like conditionals, loops, and handling user input through Scanner and Random objects.

<h2>Key Features </h2>

- Input validation using try-catch to handle invalid inputs.
- A restart mechanism allowing the user to play multiple rounds.
- Clear instructions and feedback after each guess to improve user interaction.
  
<h2>Environments Used </h2>
I used OnlineGBD to debug and write the code 

<h2>Thanks for reading and enjoy playing! </h2>
